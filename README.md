# Section Control for AgOpenGPS

Section control by external box for AgOpenGPS. Fairly simple code designed to work with switches.

To use the box without connection to AOG you can add a switch as shown in the diagram and uncomment this line:
//#define WORK_WITHOUT_AOG //Allows to use the box without aog connected (optional)

# Hardware

In the directory you will find the different sets if you want a USB, Bluetooth or Ethernet connection. The code is the same for all connection modes, only the modules change.
