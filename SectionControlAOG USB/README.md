# Section-Control-for-AgOpenGPS

Section control by external box for AgOpenGPS. Fairly simple code designed to work with switches.

To use the box without connection to AOG you can add a switch as shown in the diagram and uncomment this line:
//#define WORK_WITHOUT_AOG //Allows to use the box without aog connected (optional)
